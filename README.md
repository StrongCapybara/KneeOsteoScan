# KneeOsteoScan

**KneeOsteoScan** is a web-based application developed to assist in the early detection and classification of knee osteoarthritis using X-ray images. This project was undertaken as **Project 2** during my B.Tech at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT).

## ü©∫ Project Overview

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that can lead to significant discomfort and mobility issues. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. KneeOsteoScan leverages deep learning techniques to analyze knee X-ray images, aiming to classify the severity of osteoarthritis, thereby aiding medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.

## üöÄ Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload knee X-ray images through a simple web interface.
- **Automated Analysis**: Backend powered by a trained deep learning model to assess and classify OA severity.
- **Real-Time Results**: Instantaneous feedback on the uploaded images.
- **Secure and Efficient**: Ensures user data privacy and delivers rapid analysis.

## üìä Model Training and Dataset
The deep learning model was trained on a curated dataset of knee X-ray images, annotated for varying degrees of osteoarthritis severity. The training process involved:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, resizing, and augmentation of images.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance.

*Note*: Due to data privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository.


## üß† Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for model development and training
- **Deployment**: Local server setup; adaptable for cloud deployment
